# its-a-winter-wonder-jam
This jam is all about having some game dev fun after you get some new gear for you setup or even a full new computer! However even if you don't get something, this jam will still be a lot of fun before school starts back up again. So sit back with some friends or go it alone, because this one is gonna be a wild ride!
